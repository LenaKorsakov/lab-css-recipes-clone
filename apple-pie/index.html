          This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another
          one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me
          several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes
          one of your favorites as well!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

          <ls>1/2 cup unsalted butter</ls>
          <ls>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</ls>

      Directions Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).Melt the butter
      in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
      brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer. Place
      the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover
      with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over
      the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off. Bake 15 minutes in the
      preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
